The Ansari became angry and said "O Messenger of Allah, is it because he is your cousin?" The face of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) changed color (because of anger) and he said: "O Zubair, irrigate (your land) then block the water until it flows back to the walls around the date-palm trees." Zubair said: "By Allah, I think that this verse was revealed concerning this matter.

He saw people trading pieces of gold for Dinar and pieces of silver for Dirham. He said: "O people, you are consuming Riba (usury)! For I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: 'Do not sell gold for gold unless it is like for like; there should be no increase and no delay (between the two transactions).'" Mu'awiyah said to him: "O Abu Walid, I do not think there is any Riba involved in this , except in cases where there is a delay." 'Ubadah said to him: "I tell you a Hadith from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and you tell me your opinion! If Allah brings me back safely I will never live in a land in which you have authority over me." When he returned, he stayed in Al-Madinah, and 'Umar bin Khattab said to him: "What brought you here, O Abu Walid?" So he told him the story, and what he had said about not living in the same land as Mu'awiyah. 'Umar said: "Go back to your land, O Abu Walid, for what a bad land is the land from where you and people like you are absent." Then he wrote to Mu'awiyah and said: "You have no authority over him; make the people follow what he says , for he is right."

Beware of newly-invented matters, for every newly-invented matter is an innovation (Bid'ah) and every innovation is a going-stray. Do not let the desire for a long life causes your hearts to grow hard. That which is bound to happen is close to you, and the only thing that is far away is that which is not going to happen. The one who is doomed to Hell is doomed from his mother's womb, and the one who is destined for Paradise is the one who learns from the lessons of others. Killing a believer constitutes disbelief (Kufr) and verbally abusing him is immorality (Fusuq). It is not permissible for a Muslim to forsake his brother for more than three days. Beware of lying, for lying is never good, whether it is done seriously or in jest. A man should not make a promise to a child that he will not keep. Lying leads to immorality and immorality leads to Hell. Truthfulness leads to righteousness and righteousness leads to Paradise. It will be said of the truthful person: 'He spoke the truth and was righteous', and it will be said of the liar, 'He told lies and was immoral.'

He said: 'To believe in Allah, His angels, His books, His Messengers and the meeting with, and to believe in the Final Resurrection.' He said: 'O Messenger of Allah, what is Islam?' He said: 'To worship Allah (alone) and not to associate anything with Him; to establish the prescribed prayers, to pay the obligatory Zakat, and to fast Ramadan.' He said: 'O Messenger of Allah, what is Ihsan?  He said: 'To worship Allah as if you see Him, for even though you do not see Him, He sees you.' He said: "O Messenger of Allah, when will the Hour be?' He said: 'The one who is being asked about it does not know more than the one who is asking. But I will tell you about its signs. When the slave woman gives birth to her mistress that is one of its signs. When the shepherds compete in constructing tall buildings that is one of its signs. And there are five things which no one knows except Allah.' Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recited the Verse: "Verily, Allah, with Him (Alone) is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs. No person knows what he will earn tomorrow, and no person knows in what land he will die. Verily, Allah is All-Knower, All-Aware (of things)."

Anas said: "This is the religion of Allah which was brought by the Messengers, and which they conveyed from their Lord before there arose the confusion of people's chattering and conflicting desires.
This is confirmed in the Book of Allah, in one of the Last Verses to be revealed, where Allah says: "But if they repent." Renounce their idols and worshipping them; "And establish Salat and give Zakat." And Allah says in another Verse." But if they repent, perform Salat and give Zakat, then they are your brethren in religion." (Da'if)

Hadith: "I was confused about this Divine Decree (Qadar), and I was afraid lest that adversely affect my religion and my affairs. So I went to Ubayy bin Ka'b and said: 'O Abu Mundhir! I am confused about the Divine Decree, and I fear for my religion and my affairs, so tell me something about that through which Allah may benefit me.' He said: 'If Allah were to punish the inhabitants of His heavens and of his earth, He would do so and He would not be unjust towards them. And if He were to have mercy on them, His mercy would be better for them than their own deeds. If you had the equivalent of Mount Uhud which you spent in the cause of Allah, that would not be accepted from you until you believed in the Divine Decree and you know that whatever has befallen you, could not have passed you by; and whatever has passed you by, could not have befallen you; and that if you were to die believing anything other than this, you would enter Hell. And it will not harm you to go to my brother, 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud, and ask him (about this).' So I went to 'Abdullah and asked him , and he said something similar to what Ubayy had said, and he told me: 'It will not harm you to go to Hudhaifah.' So I went to Hudhaifah and asked him, and he said something similar to what they had said. And he told me: 'Go to Zaid bin Thabit and ask him.' So I went to Zaid bun Thabit and asked him, and he said: 'I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: "If Allah were to punish the inhabitants of His heavens and of His earth, he would do so and He would not be unjust towards them. And if He were to have mercy on them, His mercy would be better for them than their own deeds.

Then he recited: "As for him who gives (in charity) and keeps his duty to Allah and fears Him, and believes in Al-Husna. We will make smooth for him the path of ease (goodness).

Then "When fear is banished from their hearts, they say: 'What is it that your Lord has said?' They say: 'The truth. And He is The Most High, The Most Great." He said: 'Then the eavesdroppers (from among the jinn) listen out for that, one above the other, so (one of them) hears the words and passes it on to the one beneath him. The Shihab (shooting star) may strike him before he can pass it on to the one beneath him and the latter can pass it on to the soothsayer or sorcerer, or it may not strike him until he has passed it on. And he ads one hundred lies to it, and only that word which was overheard from the heavens is true."

Hadith: When the Messenger of Allah was coming back from the battle of Khaibar, night came and he felt sleepy, so he made camp and said to Bilal: "Keep watch for us tonight." Bilal prayed as much as Allah decreed for him, and the Messenger of Allah and his Companions went to sleep. When dawn was approaching, Bilal went to his mount, facing towards the east, watching for the dawn. Then Bilal's eyes grew heavy while he was leaning on his mount (and he slept). Neither Bilal nor any of his Companions woke until they felt the heat of the sun. The Messenger of Allah was the first one to wake up. The Messenger of Allah was startled and said: "O Bilal!" Bilal said: "The same thing happened to me as happened to you. May my father and mother be ransomed for you, O Messenger of Allah!" He said: "Bring your mounts forward a little." So they brought their mounts forward a little (away from that place). Then the Messenger of Allah performed ablution and told Bilal to call the Iqamah for prayer, and he led them in the prayer. When the Prophet finished praying, he said: "Whoever forgets a Salah, let him pray it when he remembers, for Allah says: And perform the prayer for My remembrance." [Ta-Ha: 14] He (one of the narrators) said: "Ibn Shihab used to recite this Verse as meaning, 'when you remember'."

Hadith: The Messenger of Allah was thinking of a horn, and he commanded that a bell be made and it was done. Then 'Abdullah bin Zaid had a dream. He said: "I saw a man wearing two green garments, carrying a bell. I said to him, 'O slave of Allah, will you sell the bell?' He said; 'What will you do with it?' I said, 'I will call (the people) to prayer.' He said, 'Shall I not tell you of something better than that?' I said, 'What is it?' he said, 'Say: Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar; Ash-hadu an la ilaha illallah, Ash-hadu an la ilaha illallah; Ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah, Ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah; Hayya 'alas-salah,  Hayya 'alas-salah; Hayya 'alal-falah, Hayya 'alal-falah;  Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar; La ilaha illallah (Allah is The Most Great, Allah is The Most Great; Allah is The Most Great, Allah is The Most Great; I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah; I bear witness that Muhammed is the Messenger of Allah, I bear witness that Muhammed is the Messenger of Allah; Come to the Prayer, Come to the Prayer; Come to the prosperity, Come to the prosperity; Allah is the Most great, Allah is the Most Great; None has the right to be worshipped but Allah)." 'Abdullah bin Zaid went out and came to the Messenger of Allah, and told him what he had seen. He said, "O Messenger of Allah, I saw a man wearing two green garments carrying a bell," and he told him the story. The Messenger of Allah said, "Your companion has had a dream. Go out with Bilal to the mosque and teach it to him, for he has a louder voice than you." I ('Abdullah) went out with Bilal to the mosque, and I started teaching him the words and he was calling them out. 'Umar Al-Khattab heard the voice and came out saying, "O Messenger of Allah! By Allah, I saw the same (dream) as him." (Hasan)Abu 'Ubaid said: "Abu Bakr Al-Hakami told me that 'Abdullah bin Zaid Al-Ansari said concerning that:
'I praise Allah, the Possessor of majesty and honor,
A great deal of praise for the Adhan.
Since the news of it came to me from Allah,
So due to it, I was honored by the information.
During the three nights.
Each of which increased me in honor.'"

Hadith: The Prophet consulted the people as to how he could call them to the prayer. They suggested a horn, but he disliked that because of the Jews (because the Jews used a horn). Then they suggested a bell but he disliked that because of the Christians (because the Christians used a bell). Then that night the call to the prayer was shown in a dream to a man among the Ansar whose name was 'Abdullah bin Zaid, and to 'Umar bin Khattab. The Ansari man came to the Messenger of Allah at night, and the Messenger of Allah commanded Bilal to give the call to the prayer. (Da'if)Zuhri said: "Bilal added the phrase "As-salatu khairum minan-nawm (the prayer is better than sleep)" to the call for the morning prayer, and the Messenger of Allah approved of that."

Hadith: "Abdul-'Aziz bin 'Abdul-Malik bin Abu Mahdhurah narrated from 'Abdullah bin muhairiz who was an orphan under the care of Abu Mahdhurah bin mi'yar that when he was preparing him to travel to Sham, he said: 'O my uncle, I am going out to Sham, and I will be asked about how you started the Adhan.' So he informed me that. Abu Mahdhurah said: 'I went out with a group of people, and we were somewhere on the road, when the Mu'adh-dhin of the Messenger of Allah gave the call to prayer in the presence of the Messenger of Allah. We heard the voice of the Mu'adh-dhin, and we were shunning it (the Adhan), so we started yelling, imitating it and mocking it. The Messenger of Allah heard us, so he sent some people who brought us to sit in front of him. He said: 'Who is the one whose voice I heard so loud?' The people all pointed to me, and they were telling the truth. He sent them all away, but kept me there and said to me: 'Stand up and give the call to prayer.' I stood up and there was nothing more hateful to me than the Messenger of Allah and what he was telling me to do. I stood up in front of the Messenger of Allah and the Messenger of Allah himself taught me the call. He said: "Say: 'Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar; Ash-hadu an la ilaha illallah, Ash-hadu an la ilaha illallah; Ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah, Ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah (Allah is the Most great, Allah is the most Great, Allah is the most Great, Allah is the most Great; I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah; I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah).'" Then he said: "Raise your voice (and say). Ash-hadu an la ilaha illallah, Ash-hadu an la ilaha illallah; Ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah, Ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah; Hayya 'alal-salah, Hayya 'alal-salah; Hayya 'alal-falah, Hayya 'alal-falah; Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar; La ilaha illallah (I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah; I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; Come to the Prayer, Come to the Prayer; Come to the prosperity, Come to the prosperity; Allah is the Most great, Allah is the Most Great; None has the right to be worshipped but Allah).'" Then he called me when I had finished saying the Adhan, and gave me a small bag in which there was some silver. Then he put his hand on the forelock of Abu Mahdhurah, then passed it over his face, then over his chest, and over his heart, until the hand of the Messenger of Allah reached his navel. Then the Messenger of Allah said: 'May Allah bless you and send blessings upon you.' I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, do you command me to give the call to prayer in Makkah?' He said: 'Yes, I command you (to do so).' Then all the hatred I had felt towards the Messenger of Allah disappeared, and was replaced with love for the Messenger of Allah. I came to 'Attab bin Asid, the governor of the Messenger of Allah in Makkah, and gave the call to prayer with him by command of the Messenger of Allah." (Sahih)He ('Abdul-'Aziz) said: "Someone who met Abu Mahdhurah told me the same as 'Abdullah bin Muhairiz told me."

By Allah, if each of you prays in his house, you will have abandoned the Sunnah of your Prophet, and if you abandon the Sunnah of your Prophet you will go astray. I remember when no one stayed behind from the prayer except a hypocrite who was known for his hypocrisy. I have a man coming supported by two others, until he joined the row (of worshippers). There is no man who purifies himself and does it well, and comes to the mosque and prays there, but for every step that he takes, Allah raises him in status one degree thereby, and takes away one of his sins."

(ﷺ) facing towards Baitul-Maqdis (Jerusalem) for eighteen
months,
then the Qiblah was changed to the Ka’bah two months after the
Prophet (ﷺ) entered Al-Madinah. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)
prayed towards Baitul-Maqdis, he would often lift his face towards
the
heavens, and Allah knew what was in the heart of His Prophet and
how
he longed to face the Ka’bah (during prayer). Jibril appeared
(in the
sky), and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) started watching him
as he was
descending between the heavens and the earth, waiting to
see what he
would bring. Then Allah revealed the words: ‘Verily, We
have seen the
turning of your face towards the heaven. Surely, We
shall turn you to
a Qiblah that shall please you, so turn your face
in the direction of
Al-Masjid Al-Haram (at Makkah). And wherever you
people are, turn your
faces (during prayer) in that direction.’
[2:144] Then someone came to
us and said: ‘The Qiblah has been
changed to the Ka’bah.’ We had
performed two Rak’ah facing
towards Jerusalem. And we were bowing. So
we turned around, and we
continued our prayer. The Messenger of Allah
(ﷺ) said: ‘O Jibril!
What about our prayer facing towards Baitul-
Maqdis?’ Then Allah
revealed the words: “And Allah would never make
your faith to be
lost.” [2:143]

concerning the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).’ They
said:
‘Why? By Allah, you did not follow him more than we did, and
you did
not accompany him for longer.’ He said: ‘Yes I am.’
They said: ‘Show
us.’ He said: ‘When the Messenger of Allah
(ﷺ) stood up for prayer,
he would say the Takbir, then he would
raise his hands parallel to his
shoulders, and every part of his body
would settle in place. Then he
would recite, then he would raise his
hands parallel to his shoulders
and bow, placing his palms on his
knees and supporting his weight on
them. He neither lowered his head,
nor raised it up, it was evenly
balanced (between either extreme).
Then he would say: “Sami’ Allahu
liman hamidah (Allah hears those
who praise Him); and he would raise
his hands parallel with his
shoulders, until every bone returned to
its place. Then he would
prostrate himself on the ground, keeping his
arms away from his
sides. Then he would raise his head and tuck his
left foot under him
and sit on it, and he would spread his toes when
he prostrated.* Then
he would prostrate, then say the Takbir and sit
on his left foot,
until every bone returned to its place. Then he
would stand up and do
the same in the next Rak’ah. Then when he stood
up after two
Rak’ah, he would raise his hands level with his shoulders
as he did
at the beginning of the prayer. Then he would offer the rest
of his
prayer in like manner until, when he did the prostration after which
the
Taslim comes, he would push one of his feet back and sit with his
weight on his left side, Mutawarrikan.’** They said: ‘You have
spoken
the truth; this is how the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to
perform
the prayer.’”

* Meaning that he would plant them in such a way that they were facing the Qiblah.

Hadith: “The Messenger of

Allah
before you die. Hasten to do good deeds before you become
preoccupied
(because of sickness and old age). Uphold the relationship
that
exists between you and your Lord by remembering Him a great deal
and
by giving a great deal of charity in secret and openly. (Then) you
will be granted provision and Divine support, and your condition will
improve. Know that Allah has enjoined Friday upon you in this place
of
mine, on this day, in this month, in this year, until the Day of
Resurrection. Whoever abandons it, whether during my lifetime or
after
I am gone, whether he has a just or an unjust ruler, whether he
takes
it lightly or denies (that it is obligatory), may Allah cause
him to
lose all sense of tranquility and contentment, and may He not
bless
him in his affairs. Indeed, his prayer will not be valid, his
Zakat
will not be valid, his Hajj will not be valid, his fasting will
not be
valid, and his righteous deeds will not be accepted, until he
repents.
Whoever repents, Allah will accept his repentance. No woman
should be
appointed as Imam over a man, no Bedouin should be
appointed as Imam
over a Muhajir, no immoral person should be
appointed as Imam over a
(true) believer, unless that is forced upon
him and he fears his sword

Chapter: Chapter: What was narrated concerning the beginning of the construction of the pulpit
Hadith: “The
Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to pray facing the trunk of a date-
palm
tree when the mosque was still a hut, and he used to deliver the
sermon leaning on that trunk. A man from among his Companions said:
‘Would you like us to make you something upon which you can stand
on
Fridays so that the people will be able to see you and hear your
sermon?’ He said: ‘Yes.’ So he made three steps for him, as a
pulpit.
When they put the pulpit in place, they put it in the place
where it
stands now. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wanted to
stand on the
pulpit, he passed by the tree trunk from which he used
to deliver the
sermon, and when he went beyond the trunk, it moaned
and split and
cracked. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came down when he
heard the
voice of the trunk, and rubbed it with his hand until it
fell silent.
Then he went back to the pulpit and when he prayed, he
prayed facing
it. When the mosque was knocked down (for renovation)
and (the
pillars, etc.) were changed, Ubayy bin Ka’b took that
trunk and kept
it in his house until it became very old and the
termites consumed it
and it became grains of dust.”

of tree) from Ghabah. It was made by so-and-so, the freed slave
of so-

(the

whispered something to her, and she smiled. I said to her: ‘What
made
you weep?’ She said: ‘I will not disclose the secret of the
Messenger
of Allah (ﷺ).’ I said: ‘I never saw joy so close to
grief as I saw
today.’ When she wept I said: ‘Did the Messenger
of Allah (ﷺ) tell
you some special words that were not for us, then
you wept?’ And I
asked her about what he had said. She said: ‘I
will not disclose the
secret of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).’
After he died I asked her
what he had said, and she said: ‘He told
me that Jibra’il used to
review the Qur’an with him once each
year, but he had reviewed it with
him twice that year, (and he said:)
“I do not think but that my time
is near. You will be the first of
my family to join me, and what a
good predecessor I am for you.” So
I wept. Then he whispered to me and
said: “Will you not be pleased
to be the leader of the women of this
Ummah?” So I smiled.’”

Hadith: “When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)
passed away, Abu Bakr was with his wife, the daughter of Kharijah, in
villages surrounding Al-Madinah. They started to say: ‘The Prophet
(ﷺ) has not died, rather he has been overcome with what used to
overcome him at the time of Revelation.’ Then Abu Bakr came and
uncovered his (the Prophet’s (ﷺ)) face, kissed him between the
eyes
and said: ‘You are too noble before Allah for Him to cause you
to die
twice. By Allah, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has indeed
died.’ ‘Umar
was in a corner of the mosque saying: ‘By Allah,
the Messenger of
Allah (ﷺ) has not died and he will never die until
the hands and
feet of most of the hypocrites are cut off.’ Then Abu
Bakr stood up,
ascended the pulpit and said: ‘Whoever used to
worship Allah, Allah is
alive and will never die. Whoever used to
worship Muhammad, Muhammad
is dead. “Muhammad is no more than a
Messenger, and indeed (many)
Messengers have passed away before him.
If he dies or is killed, will
you then turn back on your heels (as
disbelievers)? And he who turns
back on his heels, not the least harm
will he do to Allah; and Allah
will give reward to those who are
grateful.’” [3:144] ‘Umar said: ‘It

Hadith: “When they wanted to dig a
grave
for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), they sent for Abu ‘Ubaidah bin
Jarrah, who used to dig graves in the manner of the people of Makkah,
and they sent for Abu Talhah, who used to dig graves for the people
of
Al-Madinah, and he used to make a niche in the grave. They sent
two
messengers to both of them, and they said: ‘O Allah, choose
what is
best for Your Messenger.’ They found Abu Talhah and brought
him, but
they did not find Abu ‘Ubaidah. So he dug a grave with a
niche for the
Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). When they had finished
preparing him, on
Tuesday, he was placed on his bed in his house.
Then the people
entered upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in groups
and offered the
funeral prayer for him, and when they finished the
women entered, and
when they finished the children entered, and no
one led the people in
offering the funeral prayer for the Messenger
of Allah (ﷺ). The
Muslims differed concerning the place where he
should be buried. Some
said that he should be buried in his mosque.
Others said that he
should be buried with his Companions. Then Abu
Bakr said: ‘I heard the
Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: “No Prophet
ever passed away but he was
buried where he died.” So they lifted
up the bed of the Messenger of
Allah (ﷺ) on which he had died, and
dug the grave for him, then he
(ﷺ) was buried in the middle of
Tuesday night. ‘Ali bin Abu Talib,
Fadl bin ‘Abbas and his
brother Qutham, and Shuqran the freed slave of
the Messenger of Allah
(ﷺ) went down in his grave. Aws bin Khawli,
who was Abu Laila, said
to ‘Ali bin Abi Talib: ‘I adjure you by Allah!
Give us our share
of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).’ So ‘Ali said to
him: ‘Come
down.’ Shuqran, his freed slave, had taken a Qatifah which
the
Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to wear. He buried it in his grave
and
said, ‘By Allah, no one will ever wear it after you.’ So it was
buried with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).”

This is the obligation of Sadaqah which the Messenger of Allah enjoined upon the Muslims, as Allah commanded the Messenger of Allah. The ages of camels to be given (in Zakat) may be made up in sheep. So if a man has camels on which the Sadaqah is a Jadha'ah (a four-year-old she-camel) and he does not have a Jadha'ah but he has a Hiqqah (a three year old she-camel), then the Hiqqah should be accepted from him, and two sheep should be given (in addition), if they are readily available, or twenty Dirham. If a man has camels on which the Sadaqah is a Hiqqah, and he only has a Bin Labun( a two-year-old she-camel), then the Bint Labun should be accepted from him, along with two sheep or twenty Dirhams.If a man has camels on which the sadaqah is a Bint Labun, and he does not have one, but he has a Hiqqah, then it should be accepted from him, and the Zakat collector should give him back twenty Dirham or two sheep. If a man has camels on which Sadaqah is a Bint Labun, and he does not have one, but he has a Bint Makhad(a one-year-old she-camel), then the Bint Makhad should be accepted from him, along with twenty Dirham or two sheep. If a man has camels on which the Sadaqah is a Bint Makhad, and he does not have one, but he has a Bint Labun, then the Bint Labun should be accepted from him, and the Zakat collector should give him back twenty Dirhams or two sheep. Whoever does not have a Bint Makhad, but he has a Bint Labun (a two-year-old male camel), then it should be accepted from him and nothing else should be given along with it.' ”

At the time of the new date-palm harvest, they would take a bunch of dates that were beginning to ripen and hang it on a rope between two of the pillars in the mosque of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and the poor emigrants would eat from it.” One of them deliberately mixed a bunch containing rotten and shriveled dates, and thought this was permissible because of the large number of dates that had been put there. So the following was revealed about the one who did that: '… and do not aim at that which is bad to spend from it'. Meaning do not seek out the rotten and shriveled dates to give in charity: '…(thought) you would not accept it save if you close your eyes and tolerate therein.' Meaning, if you were given this as a gift you would only accept it because you felt embarrassed, and you would get angry that he had sent something of which you have no need.

Chapter: Chapter: Zihar
Hadith: "I was a man who had a lot of desire for women, and I do not think there was any man who had as great a share of that as me. When Ramadan began, I declared Zihar upon my wife (to last) until Ramadan ended. While she was talking to me one night, part of her body became uncovered. I jumped on her and had intercourse with her. The next morning I went to my people and told them, and said to them: 'Ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) for me.' They said: 'We will not do that, lest Allah reveal Quran concerning us or the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) says, something about us, and it will be a lasting source of disgrace for us. Rather we will leave you to deal with it yourself. Go yourself and tell the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about your problem.' So I went out and when I came to him, I told him what happened. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Did you really do that?' I said: 'I really did that, and here I am, O Messenger of Allah. (ﷺ) I will bear Allah’s ruling on me with patience.' He said: 'Free a slave.' I said: 'By the One Who sent you with the truth, I do not own anything but myself.' He said: 'Fast for two consecutive months.' I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, the thing that happened to me was only because of fasting.' He said: 'Then give charity, or feed sixty poor persons.' I said: 'By the One Who sent you with the truttu we spent last night with no dinner.' He said: 'Then go to the collector of charity of Banu Zuraiq, and tell him to give you something, then feed sixty poor persons, and benefit from the rest.'"

She continued to complain until Jibra'il brought down these Verses: 'Indeed Allah has heard the statement of she who pleads with you (O Muhammad) concerning her husband, and complains to Allah" (58:1)

Hadith: "Uwaimir came to 'Asim bin 'Adi and said: 'Ask the Messenger of Ailah (ﷺ) for me: "Do you think that if a man finds another man with his wife and kills him, he should be killed in retaliation, or what should he do?" 'Asim asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about that, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) disapproved of the question. Then 'Uwaimir met him ('Asim) and asked him about that, saying: 'What did you do?’ He said: I did that and you have not brought me any good. I asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he disapproved of this question.’ Uwaimir said: 'By Allah, I will go to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) myself and ask him.' So he went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and found that Qur'an had been revealed concerning them, and the Prophet (ﷺ) told them to go through the procedure of Li'an. 'Uwaimir said: 'O Messenger of Allah, (ﷺ) by Allah if I take her back, I would have been telling lies about her.' So he left her before the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) told him to do so, and that became the Sunnah for two who engage in the procedure of Li'an. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'Wait and see. If she gives birth to a child who is black in color with widely-spaced dark eyes and large buttocks, then I think that he was telling the truth about her, but if she gives birth to a child with a red complexion like a Wahrah,[1] then I think that he was lying.' Then she gave birth to a child with features resembling those of the man concerning whom she was accused."

Hadith: Hilal bin Umayyah accused his wife in the presence of the Prophet (ﷺ) of (committing adultery) with Sharik bin Sahma'. The Prophet said: "Bring proof or you will feel the Hadd (punishment) on your back." Hilal bin Umayyah said: "By the One Who sent you with the truth, I am telling the truth, and Allah will send down revelation concerning my situation which will spare my back." Then the following was revealed: "And for those who accuse their wives, but have no witnesses except themselves, let the testimony of one of them be four testimonies (i.e., testifies four times) by Allah that he is one of those who speak the truth. And the fifth (testimony should be) the invoking of the curse of Allah on him if he be of those who tell a lie (against her). But it shall avert the punishment (of stoning to death) from her, it she bears witness four times by Allah, that he (her husband) is telling a lie. And the fifth (testimony) should be that the wrath of Allah be upon her if he (her husband) speaks the truth." The Prophet (ﷺ), turned and sent for them, and they came. Hilal bin Umayyah stood up and bore witness, and the Prophet (ﷺ) said: "Allah knows that one of you is lying. Will either of you repent?" Then she stood up and affirmed her innocence. On the fifth time, meaning that the wrath of Allah be upon her if he (her husband) speaks the truth, they said to her: "It will invoke the wrath of Allah." Ibn 'Abbas said: "She hesitated and backed up, until we thought that she was going to recant. Then she said: 'By Allah, I cannot dishonor my people for ever.' Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'Wait and see. If she gives birth to a child with black eyes, fleshy buttocks and big calves, then he is the son of Sharik bin Sahma'.' And she gave birth to such a child. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'Had it not the matter been settled by the Book of Allah, I would have punished her severely.' "

I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: “It is not lawful to shed the blood of a Muslim except in one of three (cases): a man who commits adultery when he is a married person, then he should be stoned; a man who kills a soul not in retaliation for murder; and a man who apostatizes after becoming Muslim.' By Allah (SWT), I never committed adultery either during Ignorance days nor in Islam, and I have never killed a Muslim soul, and I have not apostatized since I became Muslim.”

Those who came before you were only destroyed because when one of their nobles stole, they let him off, but when one of the weak people among them stole, they would carry out the punishment on him. By Allah, if Fatimah the daughter of Muhammad were to steal, I would cut off her hand.”  (Sahih)(One of the narrators) Muhammad bin Rumh said: “I heard Laith bin Sa'd say: 'Allah(SWT) protected her (Fatimah) from stealing, and every Muslim should say this.'”

The punishment for the adulterer that we find in our Book is stoning, but many of our nobles were being stoned (because of the prevalence of adultery among them), so if we caught one of our nobles (committing adultery), we would let him go; but if we caught one of the weak among us, we would carry out the punishment on him. We said: “Come, let us agree upon something that we may impose on both noble and weak alike.” So we agreed to blacken the face and whip them, instead of stoning.'

Hadith: “We were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and Amr bin Murrah came and said: 'O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), Allah (SWT) has decreed that I be doomed, and He has not guided me to earn a living except by beating my tambourine with my hand; give me permission to sing without doing anything immoral.' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'I will not give you permission, or honor you nor give you, what you want. You are lying, O enemy of Allah. Allah (SWT) has granted you a good, lawful provision, but you have chosen the provision that Allah (SWT) has forbidden to you instead of that which He has permitted. If I had warned you before, I would have done such and such to you. Get away from me and repent to Allah (SWT). If you do that again, after this warning, I will give you a painful beating and shave your head, to make an example of you, and I will banish you from among your people, and tell the young men of Al-Madinah to come and take your goods,'Amr stood up, suffering grief and humiliation that is known only to Allah (SWT).
When he went away, the Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'Those sinners, whoever among them dies without having repented, Allah (SWT) will gather him on the Day of Resurrection just as he was in this world, effeminate and naked, with not even a piece of cloth to conceal him from the people. Every time he gets up, he will fall to the ground.'”

Then the idea of repentance occurred to him (again), so he asked who was the most knowledgeable of people, and he was told of a man (so he went to him) and said: “I have killed one hundred people. Can I repent?” He said: “Woe to you, what is stopping you from repenting? Leave the evil town where you are living and go to a good town, such and such town and worship your Lord there.” So he went out, heading for the good town, but death came to him on the road. The angels of mercy and angels of punishment argued over him. Iblis (Satan) said: “I have more right to him, for he never disobeyed me for a moment.” But the angels of mercy said: “He went out repenting.” (One of the narrators) Hammam said: “Humaid At-Tawil narrated to me from Bakr bin Abdullah that Abu Rafi said: 'So Allah (SWT) sent an angel to whom they referred (the case).

When he calculated the price in terms of camels (for Bedouins), it would vary from one time to another. When prices roses, the value (in dinars) would rise: and when prices fell, the value (in Dinar) would fall. At the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) the value was between four hundred and eight hundred dinar, or the equivalent value in silver, eight thousand Dirham. And the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ruled that if a person's blood money was paid in cattle, among those who kept cattle, the amount was two hundred cows; and if person's blood money was paid in sheep, among those who kept sheep, the value was two thousand sheep.

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Either (the Jews) will pay the blood money for your companion, or war will be declared on them.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent a letter to that effect (to the Jews) and they wrote back saying: “By Allah, we did not kill him.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to Huwayyisah, Muhayyisah and Abdur-Rahman: “Will you swear an oath establishing your claim to the blood money of your companion?” They said: “No” He said: “Should the Jews swear an oath for you?” They said: “They are not Muslims.” So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) paid the blood money himself, and he sent one hundred she-camels to them and some of them entered the house.

Hadith: “Every child

has died, and his heirs attributed him to him after he
died, he ruled
that* whoever was born to a slave woman whom he owned
at the time when
he had intercourse with her, he should be named
after the one to whom
he was attributed, but he has no share of any
inheritance that was
distributed previously. Whatever inheritance he
finds has not yet been
distributed, he will have a share of it. But
he cannot be named after
his father if the man whom he claimed as his
father did not
acknowledge him. If he as born to a slave woman whom
his father did
not own, or to a free woman with whom he committed
adultery, then he
cannot be named after him and he does not inherit
from him, even if
the one whom he claims as his father acknowledges
him. So he is an
illegitimate child who belongs to his mother’s
people, whoever they
are, whether she is a free woman or a slave.”

them out to pasture,
they do not eat anything but reward will be

their stomachs there will be reward,”

reward in conjunction with their
urine and droppings, and even when
they run here and there by
themselves, for each step they take a
reward will be written for him
– ‘As for those that are a means of
protection, a man keeps them
because they are a source of dignity and

them to accept Islam, and if they respond then accept it

their land and
move to the land of the polytheists. Tell them that if
they do that,
then they will have the same rights and duties as the
polytheists. If

the Muslim Bedouins

rulings of Allah as the
believers. But they will have no share of
Fay’* or war spoils, unless

ask them to pay the Poll-tax. If
they do that, then accept it from
them and refrain from fighting
them. But if they refuse, then seek the
help of Allah against them
and fight them. If you lay siege to them
and they want you to give
them the protection of Allah and your
Prophet, do not give them the
protection of Allah and your Prophet,
rather give them your
protection and the protection of your father and
your Companions, for
if you violate your protection and the protection
of your fathers,
that is easier than violating the protection of Allah
and the
protection of His Messenger. If you lay siege to them and they
want
you to let them come out with a promise of the judgement of Allah
and

of

(ﷺ) said: “Seventy angels have been appointed over it. Whoever
says: Allahumma inni as’alukal-‘afwa wal-‘afiyah fid-dunya
wal-akhirah; Rabbana atina fid-dunya hasanah, wa fil-akhirati
hasanah, wa qina ‘adhaban-Nar (O Allah, I ask You for pardon and
well-being in this world and in the Hereafter. Our Lord, give us good
in this world and good in the Hereafter and protect us from the
torment of the Fire), they say: Amin.” When he reached the Black
Corner (where the Black Stone is), he said: O Abu Muhammad! What have
you heard about this Black Corner? ‘Ata’ said: Abu Hurairah told
me that he heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: “Whoever faces
it is facing the Hand of the Most Merciful.’”
Ibn Hisham said to him: O Abu Muhammad, what about Tawaf? ‘Ata’ said: Abu Hurairah told me that he heard the Prophet (ﷺ) say: “Whoever performs Tawaf around the House seven times and does not say anything except: Subhan Allah wal-hamdu lillah, wa la ilaha illallah wa Allahu Akbar, wa la hawla wa la quwwata illa billah (Glory is to Allah, praise is to Allah, none has the right to be worshipping but Allah, and there is no power nor strength except with Allah), ten bad deeds will be erased from him, ten merits will be recorded for him, and he will be raised ten degrees in status.

Hadith: “We entered upon Jabir
bin ‘Abdullah, and when we reached him he asked about the people
(i.e., what their names were, etc.). When he reached me, I said: ‘I
am Muhammad bin ‘Ali bin Husain.’ He stretched forth his hand
towards my head, and undid my top button, then undid my lower button.
Then he placed his hand on my chest, and I was a young boy at that
time. Then he said: ‘Welcome to you, ask whatever you want.’ So I
asked him, and he was blind. The time for prayer came, so he stood
up, wrapping himself in a woven cloth. Every time he put it on his
shoulders, its edges came up, because it was too small. And his cloak
was beside him on a hook. He led us in prayer, then he said: ‘Tell
us about the Hajj of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).’ He held up his
hands, showing nine (fingers), and said: ‘The Messenger of Allah
(ﷺ) stayed for nine years without performing Hajj, then it was
announced to the people in the tenth year that the Messenger of Allah
(ﷺ) was going for Hajj. So many people came to Al-Madinah, all of
them seeking to follow the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and do what he
did. He set out and we set out with him, and we came to Dhul-Hulaifah
where Asma’ bint ‘Umais gave birth to Muhammad bin Abu Bakr. She
sent word to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asking what she should do.
He said: “Perform Ghusl, fasten a cloth around your waist and enter
Ihram.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed in the mosque, then he
rode Qaswa’ (his she-camel) until, when his she-camel arose with
him upon Baida’,’ Jabir said: ‘As far as I could see, I saw
people riding and walking in front of him, and I saw the same to his
right and left, and behind him, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was
among us and Qur’an was being revealed to him, and he understood
its meaning. Whatever he did, we did too. Then he began the Talbiyah of
monotheism: “Labbaika Allahumma labbaik, labbaika la sharika laka
labbaik. Innal-hamda wan-ni’mata laka wal-mulk, la sharika laka
(Here I am, O Allah, here I am. Here I am, You have no partner, here
I am. Verily all praise and blessings are Yours, and all sovereignty,
You have no partner).” And the people repeated his words. And the
Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) approved of that. And the Messenger of Allah
(ﷺ) continued to recite the Talbiyah.’ Jabir said: ‘We did not
intend (to do) anything but Hajj. We were not aware of ‘Umrah. Then
when we reached the House with him, he touched the Corner, and walked
quickly (Ramal) for three circuits and walked (normally) for four.
Then he stood at the place of Ibrahim and said: “And take you
(people) the place of Ibrahim as a place of prayer.” [2:125] He
stood with the place between him and the House. My father used to
say:* “And I do not think that he mentioned it other than from the
Prophet (ﷺ): ‘That he used to recite in those two Rak’ah (at
the place of Ibrahim): “Say: ‘O you disbelievers!’”
[Al-Kafirun (109)] and “Say: ‘He is Allah, (the) One.’”
[Al-Ikhlas (112)]
“Then he went back to the House and touched the Corner, then he went out through the gate to Safa. When he drew near to Safa he recited: “Verily, Safa and Marwah are among the symbols of Allah,” [2:158] (and said:) “We will start with that with which Allah started.” So he started with Safa and climbed it until he could see the House, then proclaimed the greatness of Allah (by saying: Allahu Akbar) and said Tahlil (La ilaha illallah) and praised Him (saying Al-Hamdulillah), and he said: “La ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lahu, lahul-mulku, wa lahul-hamdu, yuhyi wa yumit wa huwa ‘ala kulli shai’in Qadir. La ilaha illallah wahdahu, La sharika lahu anjaza wa’dahu, wa nasara ‘abduhu, wa hazamal-Ahzaba wahdahu (None has the right to be worshiped but Allah alone, with no partner or associate; His is the dominion, all praise is due to Him, He gives life and causes death and He is able to do all things. None has the right to be worshiped but Allah alone; He has no partner or associate, He fulfilled His promise, granted victory to His slave, and defeated the Confederates alone).” And he said that three times, supplication in between. Then he headed towards Marwah walking normally until, when he started to go downhill, he walked quickly (Ramal) in the bottom of the valley. When he started to go uphill, he walked normally, until he reached Marwah, and he did atop Marwah what he had done atop Safa. At the end of his Sa’y, atop Marwah he said: “If I had known before what I have come to know now, I would not have garlanded the sacrificial animal, and I would have made it ‘Umrah. Whoever among you does not have a sacrificial animal with him, let him exit Ihram and make it ‘Umrah.” So all the people exited Ihram and cut their hair, except the Prophet (ﷺ) and those who had sacrificial animals with them. Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju’shum stood up and said: “O Messenger of Allah! Is this for this year only, or forever and ever?” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) interlaced his fingers and said: “‘Umrah is included in Hajj like this,” twice. “No, it is forever and ever.” ‘Ali brought the camels of the Prophet (ﷺ), and he found that Fatimah was one of those who had exited Ihram. She had put on a dyed garment and used kohl. ‘Ali disliked this action on her part, but she said: “My father told me to do this.” ‘Ali used to say in Iraq: “So I went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), feeling upset with Fatimah because of what she had done, to ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about what she had said that he said, and that I had disliked that. He said: ‘She spoke the truth, she spoke the truth. What did you say when you began your Hajj?’” He said: “I said: ‘O Allah, I begin the Talbiyah for that for which your Messenger (ﷺ) begins the Talbiyah.’ (He said:) ‘And I have the sacrificial animal with me, so do not exit Ihram.’ He said: “The total number of sacrificial animals that ‘Ali had brought from Yemen and that the Prophet (ﷺ) brought from Al-Madinah were one hundred. Then all the people exited Ihram and cut their hair, apart from the Prophet (ﷺ) and those who had sacrificial animals with them. When the day of Tarwiyah came (the 8th of Dhul-Hijjah), they headed for Mina and began the Talbiyah for Hajj. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) rode. He prayed Zuhr, ‘Asr, Maghrib, ‘Isha’ and Fajr at Mina. Then he stayed for a short while until the sun rose, and he ordered that a tent of goat hair be pitched for him in Namirah. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) set out, and the Quraish were certain that he was going to stay at Al-Mash’ar Haram or at Al-Muzdalifah, as Quraish used to do during the Ignorance days. But the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) continued until he came to ‘Arafat, where he found that the tent had been pitched for him in Namirah, and he stopped there. Then when the sun had passed its zenith, he called for Qaswa’ and she was saddled for him. He rode until he came to the bottom of the valley, and he addressed the people and said: ‘Your blood and your wealth are sacred to you, as sacred as this day of yours, in this month of yours, in this land of yours. Every matter of Ignorance days is abolished, beneath these two feet of mine. The blood feuds of the Ignorance days are abolished, and the first blood feud of Rabi’ah bin Harith, who was nursed among Banu Sa’d and killed by Hudhail. The usuries of Ignorance days are abolished, and the first usury (that I abolish) is our usury, the usury due to ‘Abbas bin ‘Abdul-Muttalib. It is all abolished. Fear Allah with regard to women, for you have taken them as a trust from Allah, and intimacy with them has become permissible to you through Allah’s Word. Your rights over them are that they should not allow anyone whom you dislike to sit on your bedding.** If they do that, then hit them, but in a manner that does not cause injury or leave a mark. Their rights over you are that you should provide for them and clothe them in a reasonable manner. I have left behind you something which, if you adhere to it, you will never go astray: the Book of Allah. You will be asked about me. What will you say?’ They said: ‘We bear witness that you have conveyed (the message) and fulfilled (your duty) and offered sincere advice.’ He gestured with his forefinger towards the sky and then towards the people, (and said:) ‘O Allah, bear witness, O Allah bear witness,’ three times. Then Bilal called the Adhan, then the Iqamah, and he prayed Zuhr. Then he made Iqamah and prayed ‘Asr, and he did not offer any prayer between them. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) rode until he came to the place of standing, and he made his she-camel face Sakharat*** with the path in the sand in front of him, and he faced the Qiblah, then he remained standing until the sun had set and the afterglow had lessened somewhat, when the disk of the sun disappeared. Then he seated Usamah bin Zaid behind him and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) set out. He pulled Qaswa’s reins tight until her head was touching the saddle, and he gestured with his right hand: ‘O people, calmly, calmly!’ Every time he came to a hill, he released the reins a little so that she could climb. Then he came to Muzdalifah where he prayed Maghrib and ‘Isha’ with one Adhan and two Iqamah, offering no prayer in between. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) lay down until dawn came, and he prayed Fajr, when he saw that morning had come, with one Adhan and one Iqamah. Then he rode Qaswa’ until he came to Al-Mash’ar Al-Haram. He climbed it and praised Allah and proclaimed His greatness and that He is the only One worthy of worship. Then he remained standing until it had become quite bright, then he moved on before the sun rose. He seated Fadl bin ‘Abbas behind him, who was a man with lovely hair, white and handsome. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) moved on, he passed some women riding camels. Fadl started to look at them, so the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) put his hand on the other side. Fadl turned his face to the other side to look. When he came to Muhassir, he sped up a little. Then he followed the middle road that brings you out to the biggest Pillar, until he reached the Pillar that is by the tree. He threw seven pebbles, saying the Takbir with each throw, pebbles suitable for Khadhf (i.e., the size of a chickpea) throwing from the bottom of the valley. Then he went to the place of slaughter, and slaughtered sixty-three camels with his own hand. Then he handed it over to ‘Ali who slaughtered the rest, and he gave him a share in his sacrificial animal. Then he ordered that a piece from each camel be brought; (the pieces) were put in a pot and cooked, and they (the Prophet (ﷺ) and ‘Ali) ate from the meat and drank from the soup. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) hastened to the House, and prayed Zuhr in Makkah. He came to Banu ‘Abdul-Muttalib, who were providing water to the pilgrims at Zamzam, and said: ‘Draw me some water, O Banu ‘Abdul-Muttalib. Were it not that the people would overwhelm you, I would have drawn water with you.’ So they drew up a bucket for him and he drank from it.’”

he said: ‘The son of Abul-‘As?’ I said: ‘Yes, O Messenger of
Allah.’
He said: ‘What brings you here?’ He said: ‘O
Messenger of Allah, I get
confused during my prayer, until I do not
know what I am doing.’ He
said: ‘That is Satan. Come here.’ So
I came close to him, and sat upon
the front part of my feet then he
struck my chest with his hand and
put some spittle in my mouth and
said: ‘Get out, O enemy of Allah!’ He
did that three times, then
he said: ‘Get on with your work.’” ‘Uthman
said: “Indeed, I
never felt confused (during my prayer) after that.”

Hadith: “A man came to the Prophet
(ﷺ),
upon his return from Uhud, and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, in
my
dream I saw a cloud giving shade, from which drops of ghee and
honey
were falling, and I saw people collecting them in the palms of
their
hands, some gathering a lot and some a little. And I saw a rope
reaching up into heaven, and I saw you take hold of it and rise with
it. Then another man took hold of it after you rose with it, then
another man took hold of it after him and rose with it. Then a man
took hold of it after him and it broke, then it was reconnected and
he
rose with it.’ Abu Bakr said: ‘Let me interpret it, O
Messenger of
Allah.’ He said: ‘Interpret it.’ He said: ‘As
for the cloud giving
shade, it is Islam, and the drops of honey and
ghee that fall from it
(represent) the Qur’an with its sweetness
and softness. As for the
people collecting that in their palms, some
learn a lot of the Qur’an
and some learn a little. As for the rope
reaching up into heaven, it
is the truth that you are following; you
took hold of it and rose with
it, then another man till take hold of
it after you and rise with you,
then another, who will rise with it,
then another, but it will break
and then he reconnected, then he will
rise with it.’ He said: ‘You
have got some of it right and some
of it wrong.’ Abu Bakr said: ‘I
adjure you O Messenger of Allah,
tell me what I got right and what I
got wrong.’ The Prophet (ﷺ)

at this man.’ He stood behind a pillar and prayed two Rak’ah. I
got up and went to him, and said to him: ‘Some of the people said
such and such.’ He said: ‘Praise is to Allah. Paradise belongs to
Allah and He admits whomsoever He wills to it. At the time of the
Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) I saw a dream in which a man came to me and
said: “Let’s go.” So I went with him and he took me along a
great road. A road was shown to me on the left and I wanted to follow
it, but he said: “You are not one of its people.” Then a road was
shown to me on the right, and I followed him until I reached a
slippery mountain. He took me by the hand and helped me up. When I
reached the top I could not stand firm. There was an iron pillar
there with a golden ring at the top. He took my hand and helped me up
until I reached the handhold, then he said: “Have you gotten a firm
hold?” I said: “Yes.” Then he struck the pillar with his foot
and I held tight to the pillar. I told this to the Prophet (ﷺ) and he said: "You have seen something good. The great road is the plain of gathering (on the Day of Resurrection). The road that you were shown on your left is the way of the people of Hell, and you are not one of its people. The road which you were shown on your right is the way of the people of Paradise. The slippery mountain is the place of the martyrs, and the handhold that you held on tight to is the handhold of Islam. Hold on tight to it until you die." I hope to be one of the people of Paradise,' and he was 'Abdullah bin Salam."

Hadith: “The Messenger
of
Allah (ﷺ) turned to us and said: ‘O Muhajirun, there are five
things
with which you will be tested, and I seek refuge with Allah
lest you
live to see them: Immorality never appears among a people to
such an
extent that they commit it openly, but plagues and diseases
that were
never known among the predecessors will spread among them.
They do not
cheat in weights and measures but they will be stricken
with famine,
severe calamity and the oppression of their rulers. They
do not
withhold the Zakah of their wealth, but rain will be withheld
from the
sky, and were it not for the animals, no rain would fall on
them. They
do not break their covenant with Allah and His Messenger,
but Allah
will enable their enemies to overpower them and take some
of what is
in their hands. Unless their leaders rule according to the
Book of
Allah and seek all good from that which Allah has revealed,
Allah will
cause them to fight one another.’”

Hadith: “O Jibril, what is this
good
fragrance?” He said: “This is the fragrance of the grave of
the
hairdresser and her two sons and her husband.” He said: “That
began
when Khadir, who was one of the nobles of the Children of
Israel, used
to pass by a monk in his cell. The monk used to meet him
and he taught
him Islam. When Khadir reached adolescence, his father
married him to
a woman. He taught her and made her promise not to
teach it to anyone.
He used not to touch women, so he divorced her,
then his father
married him to another woman, and he taught her and
made her promise
not to teach it to anyone. One of them kept the
secret but the other
disclosed it, so he fled until he came to an
island in the sea. Two
men came, gathering firewood, and saw him. One
of them kept the secret
but the other disclosed it and said: ‘I
have seen Khadir.’ It was
said: ‘Who else saw him besides you?’
He said: ‘So-and-so.’ (The other
man) was questioned but he kept
silent. According to their religion,
the liar was to be killed. The
woman who had kept the secret got
married, and while she was combing
the hair of Pharoah’s daughter, she
dropped the comb and said: ‘May
Pharoah perish!’ (The daughter) told
her father about that. The
woman had two sons and a husband. (Pharoah)
sent for them, and tried
to make the woman and her husband give up
their religion, but they
refused. He said: ‘I am going to kill you.’
They said: ‘It
would be an act of kindness on your part, if you kill
us, to put us
in one grave.’ So he did that.” When the Prophet (ﷺ)
was taken
on the Night Journey (Isra’), he noticed a good fragrance
and asked
Jibril about it and he told him.”

in the middle of men’s hearts’ – ‘Then the Qur’an was
revealed and we learned (it) from the Qur’an and the Sunnah.’
Then he told us about its disappearance, saying; ‘A man will go to
sleep and honesty will be taken away from his heart, and only its
trace will remain, like spots without color. Then he will go to sleep
again and the remainder of the honesty will also be taken away (from
his heart) and leaving a trace like a blister, as when an ember
touches your foot and raises a blister which has nothing inside.’”
Then Hudhaifah picked up a handful of pebbles and rolled them on his
leg. He said: “People will engage in business with one another, but
there will hardly be any honest persons among them. Then it will be
said that in such and such a tribe there is an honest man, and a man
will be admired for his intelligence, good manners and strength, but
there will not be even a mustard seed of faith in his heart.”
"There was a time when I did not mind dealing with anyone of you, for if he was a Muslim, his religion would prevent him from cheating; and if he was a Christian, his Muslim ruler would prevent him from cheating. But today I cannot deal except with so-and-so and so-and-so."

(ﷺ) prayed one day, and ascended the pulpit, and he never
used to
ascend it, before that, except on Fridays. The people were
alarmed by
that, and some were standing and some were sitting. He
gestured to
them with his hand, telling them to sit. (Then he said:)
'By Allah, I
am not standing here for something that will benefit
you, an
exhortation or warning. Rather Tamim Dari has come to me and
told me
something that prevented me from taking a rest because of the
joy and
delight (I felt), and I wanted to spread that joy among you.
A cousin
of Tamim Dari told me that the wind drove them to an island
that they
did not know, so they sat in the rowing boats of the ship
and set out.
There they saw something black, with long eyelashes.
They said to it:
"What are you?" It said: "I am
Jassasah," They said: "Tell us." It
said: "I will
not tell you anything or ask you anything. Rather there
is this
monastery that you have looked at. Go to it, for there is a
man there
who is longing to hear your news and tell you news." So they
went there and entered upon him, and they saw an old man firmly
shackled, with a sorrowful appearance and complaining a great deal.
He
said to them: "Where have you come from?" They said:
"From Sham." He
said: "How are the Arabs faring?"
They said: "We are from among the
Arabs. What do you want to ask
about?" He said: "What has this man
done who has appeared
among you?" They said: "(He has done) well. He
made enemies
of some people, but Allah supported him against them and
now they
have become one, with one God and one religion." He said:
"What
happened to the spring of Zughar?" They said: "It is good;
we
irrigate out crops from it and drink from it." He said: "What
happened
to the date-palms between 'Amman and Baisan?" They
said: "They bear
fruit every year." He said: "What
happened to the Lake of Tiberias?"
They said: "It overflows
because of the abundance of water." He gave
three deep sighs,
then he said: "If I were to free myself from these
chains, I
would not leave any land without entering it on these two
feet of
mine, except for Taibah, for I have no way to enter it." The
Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'My joy is so great. This (Al-Madinah) is Taibah,
and by the One in Whose Hand is my soul, there is no narrow or broad
road in it, or any plain or mountain, but there is an angel
(standing)
over it with his sword unsheathed, until the Day of
Resurrection.'"

Chapter: Chapter: The tribulation of Dajjal, the emergence of 'Esa bin Maryam and the emergence of Gog and Magog
Hadith: "The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)
mentioned Dajjal, one morning, as something despised but also
alarming, until we thought that he was in the stand of date-palm
trees. When we came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in the evening,
he
saw that (fear) in us, and said: 'What is the matter with you?' We
said: 'O Messenger of Allah, you mentioned Dajjal this morning, and
you spoke of him as something despised but also alarming, until we
thought that he was in the stand of date-palm trees.' He said:
'There
are things that I fear more for you than the Dajjal. If he
appears
while I am among you, I will contend with him on your behalf,
and if
he appears when I am not among you, then each man must fend for
himself, and Allah will take care of every Muslim on my behalf. He
(Dajjal) will be a young man with curly hair and a protuberant eye; I
liken him to 'Abdul-'Uzza bin Qatan. Whoever among you sees him, let
him recite the first Verses of Surat Al-Kahf over him. He will emerge
from Khallah, between Sham and Iraq, and will wreak havoc right and
left. O slaves of Allah, remain steadfast.' We said: 'O Messenger of
Allah, how long will he stay on earth?' He said: 'Forty days, one
day
like a year, one day like a month, one day like a week, and the
rest
of his days like your days.' We said: 'O Messenger of Allah, on
that
day which is like a year, will the prayers of one day suffice
us?' He
said: 'Make an estimate of time (and then observe prayer).'
We said:
'How fast will he move through the earth?' He said: 'Like
a rain
cloud driving by the wind.' He said: 'He will come to some
people and
call them, and they will respond and believe in him. Then
he will
command the sky to rain and it will rain, and he will command
the
earth to produce vegetation and it will do so, and their flocks
will
come back in the evening with their humps taller, their udders
fuller
and their flanks fatter than they have ever been. Then he will
come
to some (other) people and call them, and they will reject him,
so he
will turn away from them and they will suffer drought and be
left
with nothing. Then he will pass through the wasteland and will
say:
"Bring forth your treasures," then go away, and its
treasures
will follow him like a swarm of bees. Then he will call a
man brimming
with youth and will strike him with a sword and cut him
in two. He
will put the two pieces as far apart as the distance
between an archer
and his target. Then he will call him and he will
come with his face
shining, laughing. While they are like that, Allah
will send 'Eisa
bin Maryam, who will come down at the white minaret
in the east of
Damascus, wearing two Mahrud[garment dyed with Wars
and then Saffron],
resting his hands on the wings of two angels. When
he lowers his head,
beads of perspiration will fall from it. Every
disbeliever who smells
the fragrance of his breath will die, and his
breath will reach as far
as his eye can see. Then he will set out and
catch up with him (the
Dajjal) at the gate of Ludd, and will kill
him. Then the Prophet of
Allah 'Eisa will come to some people whom
Allah has protected, and he
will wipe their faces and tell them of
their status in Paradise. While
they are like that, Allah will reveal
to him: "O 'Eisa, I have
brought forth some of My slaves whom no
one will be able to kill, so
take My slaves to Tur in safety."
Then Gog and Magog will emerge and
they will, as Allah describes,
"swoop down from every mound."[21:96]
The first of them
will pass by lake Tiberias and drink from it, then
the last of them
will pass by it and will say: "There was water here
once."
The Prophet of Allah, 'Eisa and his companions will be
besieged there
until the head of an ox would be dearer to any one of
them than one
hundred Dinar are to any one of you today. Then, the
Prophet of
Allah, 'Eisa and his companions will supplicate Allah.
Then Allah
will send a worm in their necks and the next morning they
will all
die as one. The Prophet of Allah 'Eisa and his companions
will come
down and they will not find even the space of a hand span
that is
free of their stink, stench and blood. They will pray to
Allah, and
He will send birds with necks like the necks of Bactrian
camels,
which will pick them up and throw them wherever Allah wills.
Then
Allah will send rain which will not leave any house of clay or
hair,
and it will wash the earth until it leaves it like a mirror (or
a
smooth rock). Then it will be said to the earth: "Bring forth
your
fruits and bring back your blessing." On that day a group
of people
will eat from a (single) pomegranate and it will suffice
them, and
they will seek shelter beneath its skin. Allah will bless a
milch-
camel so that it will be sufficient for a large number of
people, and
a milch-cow will be sufficient for a whole tribe and a
milch-ewe will
be sufficient for a whole clan. While they are like
that, Allah will
send a pleasant wind which will seize them beneath
their armpits and
will take the soul of every Muslim, leaving the
rest of the people
fornicating like donkeys, and upon them will come
the Hour.'"

Chapter: Chapter: The tribulation of Dajjal, the emergence of 'Esa bin Maryam and the emergence of Gog and Magog
Hadith: "The Messenger
of Allah (ﷺ) addressed us, and most of his speech had to do with
telling us about Dajjal. He warned about him, and among the things he
said was: 'There will not be any tribulation on earth, since the time
Allah created the offspring of Adam, that will be greater than the
tribulation of Dajjal. Allah has not sent any Prophet but he warned
his nation about Dajjal. I am the last of the Prophets, and you are
the last of the nations. He will undoubtedly appear among you. If he
appears while I am among you, I will contend with him on behalf of
every Muslim, and if he appears while I am not among you, then each
man must fend for himself and Allah will take care of every Muslim on
my behalf. He will emerge from Al-Khallah, between Sham and Iraq, and
will wreak havoc right and left. O slaves of Allah, remain steadfast.
I will describe him to you in a manner in which none of the Prophets
has described him before me. He will start by saying "I am a
Prophet," and there is no Prophet after me. Then a second time
he will say: "I am your Lord." But you will not see your
Lord until you die. He is one-eyed, and your Lord is not one-eyed,
and written between his eyes is Kafir. Every believer will read it,
whether he is literate or illiterate. Part of his Fitnah will be that
he will have with him Paradise and Hell, but his Hell will be a
Paradise and his Paradise a Hell. Whoever is tested with his fire
(hell), let him seek the help of Allah and recite the first Verses of
Al-Kahf, then it will be cool and safe for him, as the fire was for
Ibrahim. Part of his Fitnah will be that he will say to a Bedouin:
"What do you think, if I resurrect your father and mother for
you, will you bear witness that I am your Lord?" He will say:
"Yes." Then two devils will appear to him in the form of
his father and mother and will say: "O my son, follow him, for
he is your Lord." And part of his Fitnah will be that he will
overpower a single soul and kill him, then he will cut him with a saw
until he falls in two pieces. Then he will say: "Look at this
slave of mine; I will resurrect him now, then he will claim that he
has a Lord other than me." Then Allah will resurrect him and the
evil one will say to him: "Who is your Lord?" and he will
say: "Allah is my Lord, and you are the enemy of Allah, you are
Dajjal. By Allah, I have never had more insight about you than I have
today."

(An addition) Abul-Hasan Tanafisi said: "Muharibi told us: 'Ubaidullah bin al-Walid Al-Wassafi told us, from 'Atiyyah, that Abu Sa'eed said: "The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'That man will be the highest in status in my nation in Paradise'" - 
He said: "Abu Sa'eed said: 'By Allah, we did not think that man would be anyone other than 'Umar bin Khattab, until he passed away. -  
Muharibi said: "Then we went back to the narration of Abu Rafi'." He said: - 'Part of his Fitnah will be that he will command the sky to rain, and it will rain, and he will command the earth to bring forth vegetation and it will do so. And part of his Fitnah will be that he will pass by a clan and they will disbelieve in him, so all their flocks will perish and none will be left. And part of his Fitnah will be that he will pass by a clan who will believe in him, so he will command the sky to rain, and it will rain, and he will command the earth to bring forth vegetation and it will do so, until their flocks will come back in the evening of that day, bigger and fatter than they have ever been, with their flanks stretched and their udders full of milk. There will be no part of the earth left that he does not enter and prevail over, except for Makkah and Al-Madinah, for he will not approach them on any of their mountain paths but he will be met by angels with unsheathed swords, until he will stop at the red hill at the end of the marsh. Then Al-Madinah will be shaken with its people three times, and no hypocrite, male or female, will be left, all will come out to him. Thus it will be cleansed of impurity just as the bellows cleanses the iron of dross. And that day will be called the Day of Deliverance.'
"Umm Sharik bint Abi 'akar said: 'O Messenger of Allah, where will the Arabs be that day?' He said: 'On that day they will be few, and most of them will be in Baitul-Maqdis (Jerusalem), and their leader will be a righteous man. When their leader has stepped forward to lead them in subh prayer, 'Eisa bin Maryam will come down to them. Their leader will step backwards so that 'Eisa can come forward and lead the people in prayer, but 'Eisa will place his hand between his shoulders and say to him: "Go forward and pray, for the Iqamah was given for you." Then their leader will lead them in prayer. When he has finished, 'Eisa (as), will say: "Open the gate." So they will open it and behind it will be Dajjal with seventy thousand Jews, each of them carrying an adorned sword and wearing a greenish cloak. When Dajjal looks at him, he will start to melt as salt melts in water. He will run away, and 'Eisa (as), will say: "I have only one blow for you, which you will not be able to escape!" He will catch up with him at the eastern gate of Ludd, and will kill him. Then Allah will defeat the Jews, and there will be nothing left that Allah has created which the Jews will be able to hide behind, except that Allah will cause it to speak - no stone, no tree, no wall, no animal - except for Al-Gharqad (the box-thorn), for it is one of their trees, and will not speak - except that it will say: "O Muslim slave of Allah, here is a Jews, come and kill him!"
"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'His (Dajjal's) days will number forty years: a year like half a year, a year like a month, a month like a week, and the rest of his days will be like sparks from a fire (i.e., they will pass quickly). One of you will enter the gate of Al-Madinah in the morning and not reach its other gate until evening comes.' It was said: 'O Messenger of Allah, how should we pray on those short days?' He said: 'Estimate (the times of) the prayer, as you do on these long days, then pray.' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: "Eisa bin Maryam (as), will be a just judge and a just ruler among my nation. He will break the cross, slaughter the pigs, abolish the Jizyah and charity will be left. No one will be appointed to (collect the Zakah of) sheep and camels. Grudges and mutual hatred will disappear and the venom of every venomous creature will be removed, so that a baby boy will but his hand in a snake and it will not harm him, and a baby girl will make a lion run away, and it will not harm her; and the wolf will be among the sheep like their sheepdog. The earth will be filled with peace just as a vessel is filled with water. The people will be united and none will be worshipped except Allah. War will cease and Quraish will no longer be in power. The earth will be like a silver platter, with its vegetation growing as it did at the time of Adam, until a group of people will gather around one bunch of grapes and it will suffice them, and a group will gather around a single pomegranate and it will suffice them. An ox will be sold for such and such amount of money, and a horse will be sold for a few Dirham.' They said: 'O Messenger of Allah, why will horses be so cheap?' He said: 'They will never be ridden in war again.' It was said to him: 'Why will oxen be so expensive?' He said: 'Because all the land will be tilled. Before Dajjal appears there will be three difficult years in which the people will suffer severe famine. In the first year, Allah will command the sky to withhold one third of its rain and the earth to withhold one third of its produce. In the second year, He will command the sky to withhold two thirds of its rain and the earth to withhold two-thirds of its produce. In the third year, he will command the sky to withhold all of its rain, and not a single drop will fall, and the earth to withhold all of its produce, and nothing will grow. All cloven-hoofed animals will die, except those that Allah wills.' It was said: 'What will the people live on at that time?' He said: 'Tahlil, Takbir, Tasbih and Tahmid. That will take the place of food for them.'"
Abu 'Abdullah (Ibn Majah) said: "I heard Abul-Hasan Tanafisi say: 'I heard 'Abdur-Rahman Al-Muharibi say: "This Hadith should be sent to every teacher so that they can teach it to the children in the schools."

from it, until they leave nothing behind, and the last of

was once
water in this place.' They will prevail over the earth, then
their
leader will say: 'These are the people of the earth, and we
have
finished them off. Now let us fight the people of heaven!' Then
one
of them will throw his spear towards the sky, and it will come
back
down smeared with blood. And they will say: 'We have killed the
people of heaven.' While they are like that, Allah will send a worm
like the worm that is found in the noses of sheep, which will
penetrate their necks and they will die like locusts, one on top of
another. In the morning the Muslims will not hear any sound from
them,
and they will say: 'Who will sell his soul for the sake of
Allah and
see what they are doing?' A man will go down, having
prepared himself
to be killed by them, and he will find them dead, so
he will call out
to them: 'Be of good cheer, for your enemy is dead!'
Then the people
will come out and let their flocks loose, but they
will not have
anything to graze on except their flesh, and they will
become very fat
as if they were grazing on the best vegetation they
ever found.'"

They started with Ibrahim, and asked him about it, but he did not
have any knowledge of it. Then they asked Musa, and he did not have
any knowledge of it. Then they asked 'Eisa bin Maryam, and he said:
'I have been assigned to some tasks before it happens.' As for as
when it will take place, no one knows that except Allah. Then he
mentioned Dajjal and said: 'I will descend and kill him, then the
people will return to their own lands and will be confronted with Gog
and Magog people, who will: "swoop down from every
mound."[21:96] They will not pass by any water but they will
drink it, (and they will not pass) by anything but they will spoil
it. They (the people) will beseech Allah, and I will pray to Allah to
kill them. The earth will be filled with their stench and (the
people) will beseech Allah and I will pray to Allah, then the sky
will send down rain that will carry them and throw them in the sea.
Then the mountains will turn to dust and the earth will be stretched
out like a hide. I have been promised that when that happens, the
Hour will come upon the people, like a pregnant woman whose family
does not know when she will suddenly give birth.'"

Hadith: “And turn not
away
those who invoke their Lord, morning and afternoon...” up to His
saying: “...and thus become of the unjust.” [6:52] He said:
“Aqra’ bin
Habis At-Tamimi and ‘Uyainah bin Hisn Al-Fazri came
and found the
Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) with Suhaib, Bilal, ‘Ammar
and Khabbab,
sitting with some of the believers who were weak (i.e.,
socially).
When they saw them around the Prophet (ﷺ) they looked
down on them.
They took him aside and said: ‘We want you to sit
with us along, so
that the ‘Arabs will recognize our superiority.
If the delegations of
the Arabs come to you we will feel ashamed if
the Arabs see us with
these slaves. So, when we come to you, make
them get up from your
presence, then when we have finished, sit with
them if you wish.’ He
said: ‘Yes.’ They said: ‘Write a
document for us (binding you to
that).’ So he called for a piece of
paper and he called ‘Ali to write,
and we were sitting in a corner.
Then Jibra’il (as), came down and
said: “And turn not away those
who invoke their Lord, morning and
afternoon seeking His Face. You
are accountable for them in nothing,
and they are accountable for you
in nothing, that you may turn them
away, and thus become of the
unjust.” [6:52] Then he mentioned Aqra’
bin Habis and ‘Uyaynah
bin Hisn, then he said: “Thus We have tried
some of them with
others, that they might say: ‘Is it these (poor
believers) whom
Allah has favored from amongst us?’ Does not Allah
know best those
who are grateful.” [6:53] Then he said: “When those
who believe
in Our Ayat come to you, say: Salamun ‘Alaykum (peace be
on you);
your Lord has written (prescribed) mercy for Himself”.”
[6:54] He
said: “Then we got so close to him that our knees were
touching
his, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was sitting with us.
When he
wanted to get up, he stood up and left us. Then Allah
revealed: “And
keep yourself patiently with those who call on their
Lord morning and
afternoon, seeking His Face; and let not your eyes
overlook them,”
– and do not sit with the nobles – “desiring the pomp
and
glitter of the life of the world; and obey not him whose heart We
have made heedless of Our remembrance,” – meaning ‘Uyainah and
Aqra’ –
“and who follows his own lusts, and those affair
(deeds) has been
lost” [18:28] He said: ‘May they be doomed.’
He said: ‘May ‘Uyainah
and Aqra’ be doomed.’ Then he made the
parable for them of two men and
the parable of this world. Khabbab
said: “We used to sit with the
Prophet (ﷺ) and if the time came
for him to leave, we would get up
and leave him, then he would
leave.”

the

Hadith: “A man from my nation will be called before all of creation
on the Day
of Resurrection, and ninety-nine scrolls will be spread
out for him,
each one extending as far as the eye can see. Then Allah
will say: “Do
you deny anything of this?” He will say: “No, O
Lord.” He will say:
“Have My recording scribes been unfair to
you?” Then He will say:
“Apart from that, do you have any good
deeds?” The man will be
terrified and will say: “No.” (Allah)
will say: “Indeed, you have good
deeds with Us, and you will not be
treated unjustly this Day.” Then a
card will be brought out on
which is written Ash-hadu an la ilaha
illallah wa anna Muhammadan
‘abduhu wa rasuluhu (I bear witness that
none has the right to be
worshipped but Allah, and that Muhammad is
His slave and Messenger).
He will say: “O Lord, what is this card
compared with these
scrolls?” He will say: “You will not be treated
unjustly.” Then
the scrolls will be placed in one side of the Balance
and the card in
the other. The scrolls will go up (i.e., be light) and

go down (i.e., will weigh heavily).”

will say: ‘If we seek someone to intercede for us with our Lord, we
may find relief from our situation.’ So they will go to Adam and
will say: ‘You are Adam, the father of mankind. Allah created you
with His Hand and His angels prostrated to you. Intercede for us with
your Lord, that He might grant us relief from our situation.’ He
will say: ‘I am not the one,’ and he will mention to them and
complain of the sin that he committed. He will feel too shy to do
that (and will say): ‘Rather go to Nuh, for he is the first
Messenger whom Allah sent to the people of earth.’ So they will go
to him, but he will say: ‘I am not the one,’ and he will mention
of how he asked of Allah that of which he had no knowledge.* He will
feel too shy to do that (and will say): ‘Rather go to the Close
Friend of the Most Merciful, Ibrahim.’ So they will go to him and
he will say: ‘I am not the one. Rather go to Musa, a slave to whom
Allah spoke and to whom He gave the Torah.’ So they will go to him
and he will say: ‘I am not the one,’ and he will mention how he
killed a soul, not in retaliation for murder (and will say): ‘Rather
go to ‘Isa, the slave of Allah and His Messenger, the Word of Allah
and a spirit created by Him.’ So they will go to him, but he will
say: ‘I am not the one. Rather go to Muhammad, a slave whose past
and future sins Allah forgave.’ So they will come to me and I will
go with them.” – There was a similar report from Hasan who added
(the Prophet (ﷺ) said:) And I will walk between two rows of the
believers.” Then he went back to the Hadith of Anas. – And he
said: “And I will ask my Lord for permission and permission will be
given to me. When I see Him I will fall down prostrating, and I will
be left as long as Allah wills to leave me. Then it will be said:
‘Get up, O Muhammad. Speak, you will be heard; ask, you will be
given; intercede, your intercession will be accepted.’ I will
praise Him with praise that He will teach me, then I will intercede,
and a limit will be set. Then they will be admitted to Paradise, and
I will come back a second time. When I see Him I will fall down
prostrating, and I will be left as long as Allah wills to leave me.
Then it will be said: ‘Get up, O Muhammad. Speak, you will be
heard; ask, you will be given; intercede, your intercession will be
accepted.’ I will praise Him with praise that He will teach me,
then I will intercede, and a limit will be set. Then they will be
admitted to Paradise, and I will come back a third time. When I see
Him I will fall down prostrating, and I will be left as long as Allah
wills to leave me. Then it will be said: ‘Get up, O Muhammad.
Speak, you will be heard; ask, you will be given; intercede, your
intercession will be accepted.’ I will praise Him with praise that
He will teach me, then I will intercede, and a limit will be set.
Then they will be admitted to Paradise, and I will come back a fourth
time and will say: ‘O Lord, there is no one left except those who
are detained by the Qur’an.’” **

Qatadah (the Tabi'ee in the chain) would narrate after this hadith that Anas (ra) said "Those who said 'La illaha illa Allah' (there is no god except Allah) and had the weight of a grain of barley in good in his heart will come out of the Fire, and those who said 'La illaha illa Allah' and had a weight of a grain of wheat in good in his heart will come out of the Fire, and those who said 'La illaha illa Allah' and had a weight of a grain of dust in good in his heart will come out of the Fire."

their deeds, and they will be given permission for a length of time
equivalent to Friday on earth, when they will visit Allah. His Throne
will be shown to them and He will appear to them in one of the
gardens of Paradise. Chairs of light and chairs of pearls and chairs
of rubies and chairs of chrysolite and chairs of gold and chairs of
silver will be placed for them. Those who are of a lower status than
them, and none of them will be regarded as insignificant, will sit on
sandhills of musk and camphor, and they will not feel that those who
are sitting on chairs are seated better than them.”

Abu Hurairah said: “I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, will we see our Lord?’ He said: ‘Yes. Do you dispute that you see the sun and the moon on the night when it is full?’ We said: ‘No.’ He said: ‘Likewise, you will not dispute that you see your Lord, the Glorified. There will be no one left in that gathering with whom Allah does not speak face to face, until He will say to a man among you: “Do you not remember, O so-and-so, the day you did such and such?” And He will remind him of some of his sins in this world. He will say: “O Lord, have You not forgiven me?” He will say: “Yes, it is by the vastness of My forgiveness that You have reached the position you are in.” While they are like that, a cloud will cover them from above and will rain down on them perfume the like of whose fragrance they have never smelled before. Then He will say: “Get up and go to the honor that has been prepared for you, and take whatever you desire.” So we will go to a marketplace surrounded by the angels, in which there will be such things as eyes have never seen, ears have never heard and it has not entered the heart of man. Whatever we desire will be carried for us. Nothing will be bought or sold therein. In that marketplace the people of Paradise will meet one another. A man of elevated status will meet those who are of lower status than him, but none shall be regarded as insignificant, and he will be dazzled by the clothes that he sees on him. He will not finish the last of his conversation before better clothes appear on him. That is because no one should be sad there.’”
“He said: ‘Then we will go back to our homes where we will be met by our wives, and they will say: ‘Welcome. You have come looking more handsome and with a better fragrance than when you left us.’ And we will say: ‘Today we sat with our Lord, the Compeller, the Glorified, and we deserve to come back as we have come back.’”
